Unit testing is the execution of complete class, routine, or small program 
that has been written by a single programer or team of programmers, which 
is testedin isolation from the more complete system.

Unit testing is to test the smallest units or software components in a 
program.

Unit testing is usually done by the developers using development tools.

Integration testing is the combined execution of two or more classes, packages, 
components, or subsystems that have been created by mulitple programmers or programming teams. 
This kind of testing typically starts as soon as there are two classes to test and continues until 
the entire system is complete. It may fall under both white box and black box testing.
